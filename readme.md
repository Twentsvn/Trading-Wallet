# Trading Platform Wallet
### To build the project
```
cd /working/directory/build
make .. 
```

### Note
- It uses the data from the file `Data.csv` to execute the trade. (And you make the time run)  
- Trade happens according to my algorithm (It is mutable).

### Important
- Why? It is on coursera, where you learn OOPS concepts and it is pretty good for beginners. Highly recommended.(I audited :)
